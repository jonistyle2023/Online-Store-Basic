> This template was made from the complete web development course by **Juan Pablo de la Torre**, on the Udemy platform, Link: https://www.udemy.com/share/101r3q3@5_fLvVs9jQ2mMVq2-EC6DQL2SqoeDWqSl5Iupnb2nAumLcI88uyTGDr2y268DOEKfQ==/

This template is perfect for starting an online sales business. Of course, it currently has a basic structure, but you can easily update it and add functionality if you wish. I plan to update it in the future, while it rests in this repository, in case anyone else is interested.
